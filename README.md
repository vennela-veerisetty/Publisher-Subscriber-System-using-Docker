# Publisher-Subscriber-System-using-Docker
Implemented centralized and distributed Pub/Sub Architecture using Docker
Publish and Subscribe System using Docker. This repository consists of two projects:
--Centralised Publisher-Subscriber System.
--Distributed Publisher-Subscriber System.
These are Containerised using Docker. This is a emulation of real world's Kafka's Publisher-Subscriber System.
In Realworld Pub-Sub systems are seperated geographically so we implemented pub-sub systems on different docker containers to simulate this.
In Distributed system brokers broadcast the events to subscribers as soon as a publisher publishes an event using RIP algorithm.
